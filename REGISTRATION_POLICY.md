# Registration Policy

## Overview
The Consilar platform has been updated to implement a dual registration system: public registration for clients and admin-only registration for counsellors. This ensures better control over professional accounts while maintaining easy access for clients.

## Changes Made

### 1. Client Registration (Public)
- Clients can register themselves through the public registration page
- Registration is restricted to client accounts only
- No counsellor or admin accounts can be created through public registration

### 2. Counsellor Registration (Admin-Only)
- Only administrators can create counsellor accounts
- Mental health professionals must contact administrators for account creation
- Admin accounts cannot be created through the admin panel (security measure)

### 3. Client Registration Process
Clients can register by:
1. Visiting the registration page
2. Filling out their personal information
3. Verifying their email through OTP
4. Logging in and accessing client features

### 4. Counsellor Registration Process
Counsellors must:
1. Contact an administrator
2. Provide professional credentials and information
3. Wait for admin to create their account
4. Receive login credentials from administrator

### 5. Admin User Creation Process
Administrators can create counsellor accounts by:
1. Logging into the admin dashboard
2. Navigating to "User Management"
3. Clicking "Add User" button
4. Filling out the user details form
5. Selecting the counsellor role

### 6. Automatic Verification
- Client registrations require email OTP verification
- Admin-created counsellor accounts are automatically verified
- No OTP verification required for admin-created accounts
